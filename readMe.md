# Measurable Success Criteria

In order for the solution to be successful, it should meet the following success criteria:

1. The system should store 3 years [or more] of financial data stored about the companies in a database.

   - Justification: Alex specifically asked for this in the interview and questionnaire. Storing this data in a database allows for quick and easy access.



2. The system should allow the user to search for specific companies using user interface elements such as text boxes.

   - Justification: Alex mentioned the need to search for specific companies' stock prices during the interview. This feature is essential for users.



3. The system should produce graphs that the user can customize, particularly candlestick charts and line graphs. The system should be able to display multiple companies on the same graph.

   - Justification: Alex expressed the need for customizable graphs in the interview. Candlestick charts and line graphs were mentioned as the most useful options.



4. The system needs to be able to access recent stock prices and currency values, which will be stored in the database twice daily, using an API or web scraping.

   - Justification: Alex and other users require access to recent stock information to make well-informed financial decisions. Storing this data in the database and updating it regularly fulfills this requirement.



5. The system needs to allow the user to sort companies by various user-defined metrics and present the target companies and relevant information about them.

   - Justification: Sorting companies by user-defined metrics was proposed to Alex, and he showed enthusiasm for this feature. It saves time by providing all necessary data in one place.



6. The system should suggest relevant news links to the user based on user-defined thresholds, using web scraping.

   - Justification: This idea was proposed to Alex during the interview, and he found it useful. It saves time by providing relevant news without the need to manually search various websites.



7. The system should send email alerts to the user when a specific company that they have chosen has fluctuated by a chosen value.

   - Justification: Alex expressed his appreciation for this feature in response to the success criteria. Email alerts help keep users informed about significant fluctuations in chosen companies.



8. The system needs to be a desktop application.

   - Justification: Alex specifically requested a desktop application during the interview to keep his browser clutter-free.



9. The system needs to have a user interface element (likely a button and textbox) that allows the user to manually refresh prices for companies to get the current price.

   - Justification: Providing a manual refresh option allows users to access the most up-to-date stock prices when needed.



10. The system should have a "clear and reasonable" interface.

    - Justification: A clear and user-friendly interface enhances the usability and overall experience of the system.



11. The system should allow for user preferences to be stored in .csv files.

    - Justification: Storing user preferences in .csv files allows users, including Alex, to retain their settings across sessions and avoid the need for manual re-entry.



12. The system should use Regular Expressions to interpret and sanitize user inputs for searching and sorting.

    - Justification: Implementing Regular Expressions ensures proper interpretation and sanitization of user inputs, enhancing the accuracy and security of the system.
