# What is this project

This is my A Level (OCR) Computer Science coursework. For the coursework, we were tasked with creating a complex system for a client, to solve
a problem. 

My client is a friend who trades on the stock market. I initially approached him to see if he had any issues with whatever system he was currently using. He had a number of issues, which I used to inform the features that would be included in this project.

Ultimately, this is a one-stop-shop finance analysis system that is capable of producing graphs, sorting and searching data, and that stores ~ 3 years worth of financial data about 100 companies, stored in a database that is kept up to date.

Please find the [ToDo.md](../docs/ToDo.md) file to see features that have yet to be implemented.

Please also find the [projectReport](../docs/projectReport.docx) file to see a full project report for this project.
